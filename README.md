# coding-challenges

Hello and welcome to this series of practice. The goal is to help you re-skill and up-skill on software engineering, including preparation for technical interviews and soft skills.

We approach this by utilizing top code mastery platforms like Codility, Leetcode, HackerRank, Codewars, etc, and exploring articles, books, and other learning resources that would help improve mastery of our craft.

I hope this proves a game changer in scaling the software engineering career rung.

Cheers!
